            In the days of gold, the rule was simple: bigger pieces, bigger value. With the switch to banknotes, it's the numbers printed on paper that count, not the size. For a while, Tunisian currency seemed to ignore this old ruleâ€”the largest bill was actually the 10 TND, despite higher denominations like 20, 30, and 50 TND existing, and the smallest was the 5 TND, with 1 TND and 0.5 TND notes also in circulation.
            However, the post-Bourguiba (Modern Era) era brought back a touch of the gold standard logic to banknotes: size started to reflect value once more. A quick glance at the scatter plot now shows a clear trend: larger notes carry greater value. This isn't just a visual aid; it also offers tactile information about the bill's worth, making currency more accessible and easier to differentiate.
